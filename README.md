# QuickZip
 Simple Python app that compresses an entire directory specified by the user, and outputs the zip file wherever you want.
 
 # Info
 I made this app so that I can zip directories daily without having to go out of my way and do it manually.
 
 Now, to actually do it automatically you NEED to make a TaskScheduler entry and make it run daily/weekly/monthy you get it, I havent coded it to do that automatically evem though its possible, I might do it in the future but not now,

 
 # Other Info
Like mentioned, I plan on somehow improving this even though there isn't much left to improve, maybe automating the TaskScheduler entry but I'll see.

DO NOT build the file into a .exe as this will not generate the config file and I have no idea why, just download the raw main.py file and run it.
You'll need to download Python from www.Python.org to run the app.
